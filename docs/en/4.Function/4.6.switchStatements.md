## 4.6. switch statements

swtich statements are often used to replace multiple conditional statements. The general form is:
```wa
     switch InitialStatement, ConditionalExpression {
     case expression1:
         code block 1

     case expression2:
         code block 2

     default:
         default code block
     }
```

The switch statement will first execute the optional `InitialStatement` (the `InitialStatement,` can be omitted, which means there is no initial action), and then judge from top to bottom whether the value of the `ConditionalExpression` equals with a certain `branch expression` if equal, the `code block` of the corresponding branch will be executed; if all branch conditions are not met, the optional `default code block` will be executed (omitting the `default` branch means there is no default code block). For example:

```wa
func f(x: int) {
    switch x {
    case 0:
        println("x 为 0")

    case 1:
        println("x 为 1")

    default:
        println("x ==", x)
    }
}
```

Note that switch statements in Wa-lang languages ​​jump out by default: after entering a certain branch and executing the corresponding code block, the branch statement will jump out directly (that is, implicit `break`), which is opposite to the default behavior of C language.

Another special use of branch statements for type assertions will be described in Section 7.1.
