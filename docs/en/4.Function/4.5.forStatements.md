## 4.5. for statements

There are three basic forms of loop statements:
```wa
     for { code block }
     for ConditionalExpression { code block }
     for InitialStatement; ConditionalExpression; LoopOperationStatement { code block }
```

Among them, `for {code block}` will keep looping until the statements in the code block use the `break` keyword to exit the loop. Using the `continue` keyword will skip subsequent statements and execute the next loop, for example:
```wa
    i: int
    for {
        i++
        if i == 2 {
            continue
        }
        println(i)
        if i == 3 {
            break
        }
    }
```
The above code will output:
```
1
3
```

`for ConditionalExpression {code block}`, before each time the loop executes `code block`, it will judge whether `ConditionalExpression` is `true`, if so, execute the code block, otherwise exit the loop. Statements within a code block can also use `break` and `continue` to exit the loop or skip subsequent statements to execute the next loop:
```wa
     i: int
     for i < 3 {
         println(i)
         i++
     }
```

`for InitialStatement; ConditionalExpression; LoopOperationStatement {code block}`, it first executes the `InitialStatement` once, and then checks whether the `ConditionalExpression` is `true` before each execution of the `code block`, and executes it if it is code block, otherwise exit the loop; after each code block is executed, a `LoopOperationStatement` will be executed. Using the `break` keyword in a code block will exit the loop directly, and using the `continue` keyword will skip subsequent statements and execute the next loop (at this time the `LoopOperationStatement` will still be executed), for example:
```wa
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
        if i == 1 {
            continue
        }
        println(i)
        if i == 2 {
            break
        }
    }
```

The above code will output:
```
0
2
```
