## 4.4. if statements

The general form of conditional statements is:
```wa
     if initial statement, conditional expression {
         code block 1
     } else {
         Code block 2
     }
```

Among them, `conditional expression` must be of Boolean type. The conditional statement first executes the optional `initial statement` (`initial statement,` can be omitted, which means there is no initial action), and then determines whether `conditional expression` is` true`, if so, execute `Code Block 1`, otherwise execute `Code Block 2`. `else {...}` may be omitted if no action is required if `conditional_expression` is `false`.

It should be noted that by default, statement ends with a line break, so the `else` statement needs to be on the same line as the `}` of the `if` code block. If `else` starts a new line, a compilation error will occur.

The following is an example of multiple conditional statement:
```wa
func Compare(x, y: int) => int {
    if x < y {
        return 1
    } else if x > y {
        return -1
    } else {
        return 0
    }
}
```
