## 2.4. Constant declaration

The constant declaration starts with the keyword `const`, and the general syntax is as follows:

```wa
const 常量名: 类型 = 常量值
```

For example:

```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

const Answer: i32 = 42
const aConstString: string = "你好，凹语言"

func main {
    println(Answer)
    println(aConstString)
    println(aConstInt)
}

const aConstInt = 13
```

The output of this program is as follows:

```
42
你好，凹语言
13
```

When declaring a constant, if you do not specify a type (such as `aConstInt` in the above example), then it will be an **untyped constant**. There are 4 types of untyped constants: `untyped integer`, `untyped floating point number`, `untyped characters`, `untyped strings`, respectively:

```wa
const aUntypedInt = 11       // untyped integer
const aUntypedFloat = 13.0   // untyped floating point number
const aUntypedRune = 'a'     // untyped characters
const aUntypedString = "abc" // untyped strings
```

Arithmetic and logical operations on constant values are completed at compile time, such as:

```wa

const K = 4200000000000000000000000
const J = 4200000000000000000000000

func main {
    println(K/J)
}
```

Although the values of `K` and `J` both exceed the expression range of `i64`(the largest type in Wa-lang), the value of `K/J` can still be printed correctly. This also reflects that **numeric constants have an expression range and precision that exceeds the basic type of variables**.

The relevant rules when assigning constants to variables will be discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
