## 2.2. Global variable declaration

Global variable declaration starts with the keyword `global`, and the general syntax is as follows:

```wa
global VarName: Type = initial value expression
```

For example:

```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

global aInt: i32 = 42     // 32-bit signed integer
global _num: f32 = 952.7  // 32-bit floating point number

func main {
    println(aInt)
    println(_num)
    println(名字)
    println(counter)
}

global 名字: string = "张三" // string
global counter: u32         // 32-bit unsigned integer
```

The output of this program is as follows:

```
42
952.7
张三
0
```

Global variables can be used anywhere inside the module - even if the declaration and use of global variables are in different source files, as long as they are in the same module; in the source file, there is no need to "declare first and then use". In the above example, the variables `name` and `counter` can reflect this feature.

It should be noted that the variable `counter` in the above example is declared without an initial value:
> In Wa-lang, variables that are not given an initial value are always initialized with a value of 0, which helps eliminate uncertainty.
