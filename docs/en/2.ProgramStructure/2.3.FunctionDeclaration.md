## 2.3. Function declaration

The function declaration starts with the keyword `func`, and the general syntax is as follows:

```wa
func FunctionName (parameter list) => (return value list) {function body}
```

For example：

```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

func swap(i, j: i32) => (i32, i32) {
    return j, i
}

func main {
    a, b := swap(4, 2)
    println("a:", a, ", b:", b)
    println(add(a, b))
}

func add(i, j: i32) => i32 {
    return i + j
}
```

The output of this program is as follows:

```
a: 2 , b: 4
6
```

For functions without return values, the `=> (return value list)` part can be omitted, and for functions without input parameters, the `(parameter list)` part can be omitted, such as in the above example: `func main {... }`, which is the abbreviation of: `func main() => () {...}`.

Like global variables, functions can be declared in any source file within a package and do not require "declare before use".

See Chapter 4 for more information about functions.
