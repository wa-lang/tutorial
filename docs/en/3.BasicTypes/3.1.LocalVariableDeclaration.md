## 3.1. Local variable declaration

Chapter 2 introduces global variable and constant declarations. Also commonly used is local variable (variables defined within a function) declaration. Its general syntax is:

```wa
VarName: Type = initial Value
```

What is different from all variables and constants is that the declaration of local variables does not start with a keyword; when declaring a local variable, if the `= initial value` part is omitted, the variable will be initialized with a value of 0, such as:

```wa
    aI32: i32 = 42
    aString: string = "你好"
    aF32: f32  // 0.0
```

Another commonly used syntax for declaring local variables uses the short-declaration `:=`. The syntax is as follows:

```wa
VarName := expression
```

When using this writing method, the type of the variable will be consistent with the type of the expression on the right side of the short-declaration, and the value of the expression will be assigned to the initial value of the local variable, such as:

```wa
    a := 13          // int
    f := 3.14        // f64
    s := genString() // string
...
func genString() => string { return "Hello" }
```

> Wa-lang is a statically typed language. The type of a legal expressions can be inferred at compile time, so the type of a expression is determined. The `:=` syntax is similar to C++'s `auto` type.
