## 6.4. Embedded structure

When declaring a structure type, if the type of a member is a structure but the name of it is omitted, this usage is called **embedded structure**. For example, in the following code, the structure `Sc` is embedded The `Sp` member:
```wa
type Sp struct {
    x: i32
}

type Sc struct {
    Sp // embedded structure
    y: i32
}
```

The member name of the embedded structure is its type name, and we can still use the selector `.` to access it, such as the following printing code:
```wa
    v: Sc
    println(v.Sp.x)
```

In this example, you can even omit the `.Sp` part. For example, the above code is equivalent to the following code:
```wa
    v: Sc
    println(v.x)
```

In this usage, the structure `Sp` appears to be embedded in the structure `Sc`, which is where the name **embedded structure** comes from. However, if the structure contains a member with the same name as the embedded structure, it cannot be omitted when accessing the member with the same name of the embedded structure, for example:
```

type Sp struct {
    x: i32
}

type Sc2 strct {
    Sp
    x: f32
}

func main(){
    v: Sc2
    println(v.x)    // Print Sc2.x, its type is f32
    println(v.Sp.x) // Print Sc2.Sp.x, its type is i32
}
```

In addition to being able to reuse the data layout of a type, another important function of an embedded structure is that it can reuse type methods. The structure will automatically have the methods of the embedded type, for example:
```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

type Sp struct {
    x: i32
}

func Sp.Show {
    println(this.x)
}

type Sc struct {
    Sp
    y: i32
}

func main {
    v := Sc{Sp:Sp{x: 42}, y: 13}
    v.Show() // 42
}
```
> When declaring an embedded structure literal, the name of the embedded structure cannot be omitted, such as `Sc{Sp:Sp{x: 42}, y: 13}` in the above example. If it is omitted like `{x: 42, y : 13}`, it will be considered illegal.

After `Sp` is embedded in `Sc`, Sc obtains the method of Sp, so that the variable `v` of type `Sc` can perform the `Show` operation; in this example, `v.Show()` is equivalent to` v.Sp.Show()` . If the structure has a method with the same name as the embedded structure, the processing method is similar to the member with the same name, for example:
```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

type Sp struct {
    x: i32
}

func Sp.Show {
    println(this.x)
}

type Sc struct {
    Sp
    x: f32
}

func Sc.Show {
    println(this.x)    
}

func main {
    v := Sc{Sp:Sp{x: 42}, x: 13.14}
    v.Show()    // 13.14
    v.Sp.Show() // 42
}
```

In order to achieve object reuse, Wa-lang does not adopt inheritance (which is different from C++), but uses combination. The embedded structure is a concrete manifestation of **combination**. The embedded structure reuses the memory layout and method set of the embedded type. Together with the interface (to be introduced in Chapter 7), it constitutes Wa-lang's foundation of abstraction and reusing of objects.
