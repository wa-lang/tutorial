## 7.3. Summary of type assertions

Section 7.1 introduces how to obtain the specific value contained in an interface value of type `interface{}` through type assertion. This usage still holds for non-null interface values, for example:
```wa

type Printer interface {
    Print()
}

type T1 struct {
    i: i32
}

func T1.Print { println("This is T1, this.i:", this.i) }

type T2 struct {
    s: string
}

func T2.Print { println("This is T2, this.s:", this.s) }

func doConcrete(p: Printer) {
    switch v := p.(type) {
    case *T1:
        v.Print()

    case *T2:
        v.Print()
    }
}

func main {
    v1 := T1{i: 42}
    doConcrete(&v1) // This is T1, this.i: 42

    v2 := T2{s: "hello"}
    doConcrete(&v2) // This is T2, this.s: hello
}
```

Note that `v.Print()` in function `doConcrete` is a direct call, not an interface call, because in the `case *T1` branch, the type of `v` is `*T1`. In addition, non-null interface values can also perform concrete type assertions in the form of `v, ok = iface.(Type)`, which is consistent with the application method of null interface values in Section 7.1.

In fact, the usage of type assertions goes beyond this. In some cases, a concrete type `*T` may satisfy multiple interfaces `I1` and `I2` at the same time. Then when the interface value of an `I1` contains concrete value type of `*T`, you can directly obtain an interface value of type `I2` through type assertion on the interface value, for example:
```wa
// 版权 @2023 凹语言 作者。保留所有权利。

type I1 interface {
    f1()
}

type I2 interface {
    f2()
}

type T struct {
    i: i32
}

func T.f1 { println("T.f1(), T.i:", this.i) }

func T.f2 { println("T.f2(), T.i:", this.i) }

func main {
    v1 := T{i: 42}

    i1: I1 = &v1
    i1.f1() // T.f1(), T.i: 42

    i2, ok := i1.(I2) // 断言为另一个接口
    if ok {
        i2.f2() // T.f2(), T.i: 42
    }
}
```

This usage is generally seen in getting a non-null interface from an `interface{}` value.

In addition to type assertions of the form `v, ok = iface.(Type)`, there is another pattern of type assertions:
```wa
    v = iface.(Type)
```

This mode omits the `ok` flag indicating whether the operation was successful and only returns the value of the asserted type. If a type assertion fails, a runtime exception will be triggered, and it is recommended to only use this pattern if you are absolutely certain that the assertion will not fail.
